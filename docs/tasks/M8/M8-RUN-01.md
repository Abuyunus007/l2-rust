# M8-RUN-01: Runbook and milestone checks

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Milestone | M8 |
| Model | opus |
| Review | full |
| Reference | no (copy the merged M0..M7 code around it) |
| Depends on | E2E-01 |
| Size | S |

## Goal
`docs/runbooks/m8-test.md` (checkpoints CP-M8a..d as in `docs/tasks/M8/DRAFT.md`), the admin commands, the known limits.

## Java source (the spec)
- `C:\l2-rust\l2jmobius\java\org\l2jmobius\gameserver`

## Files
- `docs/runbooks/m8-test.md`

## Requirements
1. Java behaviour, messages, packets, HTML and DB rows exactly (D-39: the Java GS shares the DB; D-49..D-53 for global writes and fresh reads).
2. Single-owner world, ids not references, timers on the wheel, world RNG; no unwrap/expect on external data; no DB call or await in a tick (D-15: request/answer through the outbox).
3. Port the packets you need yourself in `crates/l2-protocol-game/src/{client,server}/<area>.rs` with round-trip tests, dispatch arms and proxy decoders (unless M8-GPROTO-11 already has them: check main first).
4. Small wire-ins in shared files are allowed: add your lines only. List every marker you resolve and every one you leave.

## Out of scope
- Quests, AI scripts, instance/event scripts, community board (the script milestone, D-05); customs, premium, item mall (M9).

## Tests (must exist and pass)
- n/a

## Done when
- [ ] fmt, clippy -D warnings, test pass (`CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, `-j 4`); `git merge main` before the final checks
- [ ] committed as `M8-RUN-01: <summary>`
- [ ] report delivered in the agent's report format (what you left and why, every guess)

## Notes from the orchestrator
- Read CLAUDE.md (safety rules), DECISIONS (D-15, D-39, D-49..D-53), the `docs/design/*.md` of the area you touch first.
- Up to seven workers run at the same time: in shared files (`lib.rs`, `world.rs`, `command.rs`, `outbox.rs`, `timer.rs`, `dispatch.rs`, `persist.rs`, `world_data.rs`) only add your lines; after `git merge main` watch for doubled `mod`/`use` lines.
- DB tests use `l2_db::GAME_SCHEMA`; add a schema copy to `crates/l2-db/sql/game/` for every new table.
